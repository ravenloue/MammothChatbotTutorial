## Overview

This is a very simplistic chat-bot that uses JavaScript commands to prompt a user with question and populate responses based on their answers. I decided to add some comments to explain the functionality that are not present in the tutorial presented by Mammoth Interactive. 

### The idea

- Create a "chatbot" website
  - Create the forms used by the website
  - Build the functionality in JavaScript
  - Use Bootstrap to add some basic CSS to the page

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- JSitor

### What I learned

Many thanks to Mammoth Interactive for their tutorial for this process. Up until now I hadn't really handled much JavaScript, and this makes me feel much more confident going forward.

### Continued development

- January 16, 2023
  - I finished the tutorial and added comments as I went along to explain functionality. I might come back to this later with more CSS or to learn more about Bootstrap
